## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher) - You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Installation

#### 1. Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saddamarbaa/LinkedIn-clone-app-react-typescript.git
```

#### 2. Go to the Project Directory

```bash
cd LinkedIn-clone-app-react-typescript
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies and Set Up Environment Variables

Once you‚Äôve cloned the repository, navigate to the project folder and install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update the necessary values.

#### 4. Set up Firebase

For user authentication, you'll need to set up Firebase:

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Create a new project or select an existing project.
3. Enable Firebase Authentication (Email/Password and Google).
4. Copy the Firebase config and add it to the `.env` file in your project.

#### 5. Run the Project

Once the setup is complete, you can run the project locally using:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, and you can view the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üåç Environment Variables

To configure the project, you'll need to add the necessary environment variables. Follow these steps:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
2. Update the environment variables with your Firebase configuration:

```env
VITE_REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=""
VITE_REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN=""
VITE_REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID=""
VITE_REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET=""
VITE_REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=""
VITE_REACT_APP_APP_ID=""
```

## üì¶ Deployment

### Deploying to Production

1. **Prepare Environment Variables**:

   Ensure that the necessary environment variables are set up in your production environment:

   - `VITE_REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
   - `VITE_REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN`
   - `VITE_REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID`
   - `VITE_REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET`
   - `VITE_REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
   - `VITE_REACT_APP_APP_ID`

2. **Push Your Code to a Git Repository**:

   Push your code to a remote repository like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

3. **Set Up a Hosting Service**:

   You can deploy the app on platforms like:

   - **Vercel**:
     ```bash
     npm i -g vercel
     vercel login
     npm run build
     vercel --prod
     ```

   - **Netlify**:
     ```bash
     npm i -g netlify-cli
     netlify login
     npm run build
     netlify deploy --prod
     ```

   Set the necessary environment variables in the respective dashboard (Vercel or Netlify).

4. **Set Up Firebase**:

   Ensure that Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and Storage are configured as needed in your Firebase Console. Ensure that the Firebase environment variables are correctly set in your deployment platform.

5. **Additional Considerations**:

   - **Security**: Ensure that sensitive information (like API keys) is securely stored in environment variables.
   - **Build Process**: Always run `npm run build` before deploying to ensure an optimized production build.

Once deployed, your application will be live, and you can access it through the provided URL from Vercel or Netlify.
